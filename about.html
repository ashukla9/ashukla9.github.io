	<h1 style="text-align: center; padding: 15% 0;">About This Project</h1>
	
	<h2 style="text-align: center;">How It All Began</h2>
	<p>My name is Anya Shukla, and I am a high school student; I created this project because I wanted to raise awareness about Alzheimer's disease. 
	I first learned about Alzheimer's in 2019, when I listened to a <a href="https://townhallseattle.org/in-the-moment-episode-56/" target="_blank">talk</a> by Dr. Nathan Price, who works at the Institute for Systems Biology (ISB). 
	He described the use of personalized medicine to treat Alzheimer's, a disease with a variety of individual-specific risk factors and progression patterns. 
	In fact, his team had discovered a way to potentially slow down or reverse the disease.</p>
	<p>Later, in the summer of 2019, I participated in a "STEAM Towards a Healthier World" modified internship at ISB. There, we discussed how to integrate
	art and science. During that program, I made an art piece that integrated scientific information, which has since inspired me to create the brain art in this project.</p>
	<p>In March of 2020, I discovered foundry10's high school internship program, which would, in my own words, allow me to work on a passion project for eight weeks while getting paid. 
	I decided to apply with an idea for an art piece to raise awareness for Alzheimer's. I had initially wanted this piece to be physical, but then 
	thought that with coronavirus and for accessibility reasons, it would be best if this was all online.</p> 
	<ul>
		<li>Pre-Internship: I reached out to the Institute for Systems Biology for potential interviewees. I spoke with members of their Alzheimer's research team, who then put me in contact with other interviewees.</li>
		<li>Week 1: Research and artwork. I learned about dementia and Alzheimer's by watching Coursera videos and HBO documentaries. I started putting together my brain video.</li>
		<li>Week 2: Coding practice + research. I began learning how to code in HTML and CSS through online coursework. I began planning the website and continued listening to podcasts about Alzheimer's.</li>
		<li>Week 3: Coding + interviews. I began to code my actual website. I conducted interviews and began to edit together my podcasts.</li>
		<li>Week 4-5: Editing. I edited together two of my podcasts.</li>
		<li>Week 6: Animation. I created a few animated videos in Photoshop to add to the website.</li>
		<li>Week 7: Coding (but in R). I did some analysis of Alzheimer's data in the hopes of incorporating that work into my website.</li>
		<li>Week 8: Infographic + final touches. I created an infographic with scientific information about Alzheimer's. I added everything to my website and finalized formatting, then pushed my first version of the website to GitHub!</li>
	</ul>
	<p>I'd like to expand this piece by adding more interviews and artwork, as well as creating a line of cards (like birthday cards or greeting cards) 
	with my artwork, which I can then sell to raise funds for Alzheimer's research.</p> 
	<h2 style="text-align: center;">Creating This Site</h2>
	<p>I designed this site intentionally, as I wanted to incorporate scientific information about Alzheimer's into this project. 
	For example: this site has a clean, minimalist design approach. People with Alzheimer's prefer order to chaos, as clutter or mess can make them confused or agitated.
	As well, I utilized clear color contrast: visual contrast assists people with Alzheimer's, and caregivers will often use neon tape around the house to alert their loved ones to important or dangerous objects. 
	Finally, I chose to incorporate visual art, audio, and videos in order to make the site and disease more accessible for people with no previous exposure to Alzheimer's disease. 
	The use of multimedia also alludes to the beneficial impact of art (music, visual art, etc.) in the lives of people with Alzheimer's.</p>
